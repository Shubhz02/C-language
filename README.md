#Introduction to C Language: 
  The C programming language is one of the most widely used and fundamental programming languages. It was developed by Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s at Bell Labs and has since become the foundation for many modern programming languages. Known for its efficiency and flexibility, C is widely used for developing system software, applications, and embedded systems.
  C gives programmers the control they need over computer hardware while also providing an easy-to-learn and powerful tool for software development.

#Syllabus Overview of C Language:
